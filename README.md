# My-Computer-Vision-Projects
A plethora of different computer vision-based projects I have done in my own leisure. The codes written are entirely in Python. A synopsis of each project can be found below in this Readme file.

<h2>Live Color Detection</h2>
This project, "Live Colour Detection," is a Python-based computer vision application designed to detect and highlight specific colors in real-time video feed. Using OpenCV and PIL libraries, the program captures live video through a webcam, identifies a target color within the video frames, and outlines the detected areas with bounding boxes.
